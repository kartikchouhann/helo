Components and Cost Estimation
Azure App Service:

Used to host your 7 APIs and 1 web app.
Pricing varies based on the tier (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium, Isolated).
Azure API Management (APIM):

Used to manage and route traffic to your APIs.
Pricing varies based on the tier (Developer, Basic, Standard, Premium, Consumption).
Azure Container Registry (ACR):

Used to store your Docker images.
Pricing is based on the storage and operations (Basic, Standard, Premium).
Azure Pipelines:

Used for CI/CD.
Includes free tier with 1,800 minutes per month, additional minutes are charged.
Azure SQL Database:

Used to store your application data.
Pricing varies based on the tier and performance level (DTUs, vCores).
Other Services:

Storage for logs, monitoring, and any additional services like Azure Key Vault.
Example Calculation
Assumptions:

App Service Plan: Standard S1 (100 total ACU, 1.75 GB RAM) for each app.
API Management: Standard tier.
ACR: Standard tier.
Azure Pipelines: Additional build minutes.
SQL Database: Standard S3 (100 DTUs).
1. Azure App Service
Standard S1: $73.84/month per instance.
Total for 8 instances (7 APIs + 1 web app): 8 * $73.84 = $590.72/month.
2. Azure API Management
Standard tier: $548.63/month.
3. Azure Container Registry
Standard tier: $0.167 per GiB storage, $0.0035 per 10,000 operations.
Estimate 50 GiB storage: 50 * $0.167 = $8.35/month.
Estimate 1,000,000 operations: 100 * $0.0035 = $3.50/month.
Total: $8.35 + $3.50 = $11.85/month.
4. Azure Pipelines
Free tier: 1,800 minutes/month.
Additional minutes (estimate 5,000 total minutes): (5000 - 1800) * $0.002 = $6.40/month.
5. Azure SQL Database
Standard S3 (100 DTUs): $149.91/month.
6. Additional Costs (Logs, Monitoring, etc.)
Estimate additional costs: $50/month.
