Removed the EventBridge rule `databases-storage-alert-rule` as part of DEVOPS-3503. 
Tested in sandbox – confirmed Terraform destroyed the rule/target and AWS CLI shows it’s gone. 
SNS topic `vas-devops-events` remains intact. 
Ready for review.



Background

As part of DEVOPS-3503, we are decommissioning the EventBridge rule databases-storage-alert-rule.
This rule was listening to RDS genetics DB events (vas-db-genetics) and publishing notifications to the vas-devops-events SNS topic.
The rule is no longer required post-migration and must be removed from all environments.

What was changed

Removed the databases-storage-alert-rule block from:

sandbox.tfvars

staging.tfvars

prod.tfvars

(also checked management/security — no further references found).

Retained the vas-devops-events SNS topic, since other rules still publish to it.

No other EventBridge rules were modified.

Validation

Ran terraform plan in sandbox:

Confirmed only the EventBridge rule and target show as - destroy.

Applied in sandbox:

Verified with aws events list-rules --region us-west-2 → databases-storage-alert-rule no longer present.

Confirmed vas-devops-events SNS topic still exists and is used by other rules.

Staging/Prod promotion to follow after approvals.

Rollback

Re-add the same block into tfvars and apply; Terraform will re-create the rule and target.

🔹 Screenshots & Evidence (attach in PR)

📸 Terraform plan output (showing - destroy).

📸 AWS CLI aws events list-rules after sandbox apply (showing rule removed).

🔹 Checklist

 I ran the pre-commit linter (format, tfsec, checkov)

 I validated the security and static analysis output

 I deployed to sandbox and confirmed the EventBridge rule was removed

 I will promote to staging and prod after PR approval

 I updated documentation if necessary
